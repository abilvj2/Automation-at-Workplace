# Automation-at-Workplace

The situation is happening in the workplace where I have to collect some information from the customers and store it in an excel file where all the information of the customers are present. I am not allowed to entire the data directly to the spreadsheet as it would cause in data privacy issues.

Currently the project in on hold as there is an issues of all the computers gets data wipped at 2:00am everyday. Thus the automation with the python on the computer won't be able to suitable. Working on making a UI for the input part and making the program as an installable file so that it can be kept in the reserved area which does not get wipped everyday. 

I have implemented a cloud version as well but needs several modifications.
